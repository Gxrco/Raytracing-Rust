# Diorama Minecraft - Snonwy Night

This project was developed using Rust and incorporates assets inspired by the original textures of Minecraft. The primary objective was to showcase my skills in ray tracing by rendering images with a framebuffer. The implementation features a variety of textures, colors, and normal maps, allowing for a nuanced understanding of light behavior as it interacts with different objects.

Throughout the project, I focused on key concepts of ray tracing, including how light rays interact with surfaces, reflections, refractions, and shadows. By utilizing normal maps, I was able to create more realistic surface details, enhancing the overall visual quality of the rendered images. This project not only demonstrates my technical abilities in Rust programming and graphics rendering but also deepens my understanding of the physical principles that govern light behavior in a 3D environment.
